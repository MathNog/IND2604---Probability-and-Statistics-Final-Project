## About this Repository

This repository contains the final project developed for the course **IND2604 ‚Äì Probability and Statistics** at PUC-Rio.

The project explores whether **public interest in financial topics**, as measured by **Google Trends**, can help explain or predict the behavior of the Brazilian stock market. Specifically, it investigates the explanatory power of search volume related to economic terms over the **Ibovespa Index** using a **multiple linear regression model**.

The study uses:
- Daily Google Trends data for 10 finance-related keywords
- Daily closing prices of the Ibovespa Index
- Macroeconomic control variables (SELIC and CDI rates)

The model tests both individual and joint statistical significance of the search trends, and diagnostic tests are conducted to assess the model specification.

### Key Findings
- Google Trends for terms like ‚ÄúIbovespa‚Äù and ‚ÄúStocks‚Äù showed statistically significant coefficients.
- The overall inclusion of Google Trends improved model explanatory power.
- Despite some violations in residual diagnostics (due to COVID-19 shocks), the model provided valid inferential insights.
